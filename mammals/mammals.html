			<p>If you thought Singapore had no rare species of animals, think again! I too was surprised to learn about the presence of an <em>endemic</em> species
			in Singapore, endemic meaning that the species is found only in that particular area.
			</p>
			<p> The Raffles Banded Langur (<span class="species">Presbytis femoralis</span>) can only be found in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve of Singapore and the forests of
			Southern Johor, and they are critically endangered. Take a look at the short clip to observe the Raffles Banded Langur in their home.

					<p class="para">Once driven out of Singapore by our rapid urbanisation, recent efforts to rebuild our waterways and canals have
					attracted the Smooth-coated Otters (<span class="species">Lutrogale perspicillata</span>) back from Johor, Malaysia, back to Singapore.</p>
					<p class="para">You never know when they'll appear! Whether I am walking along Sungei Tampines to get to the mangrove boardwalk, or strolling along
					the bridges above the intertidal shores of Labrador Park, it's always a pleasant surprise to hear members of public call out that an otter family has
					been spotted.

					<p class="para">While trekking up Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, anticipations ran high as I awaited the sight of a gliding mammal - the Sunda Colugo
					(<span class="species">Galeopterus variegatus</span>). But alas, lady luck was not on my side that day, and the heavy rains only dampened the mood
					further.</p>
					<p class="para">The Sunda Colugo doesn't fly but rather <em>glides</em>, using its extendable skin membrane to act as a parachute to aid in its
					glide between trees. If you are luckier than me, you might find one clinging onto the tall woody trees, forming a weird lump that camouflages almost
					perfectly on the rough bark of the trees. Try spotting the baby colugo peeking out from the side of the mother!
